# Mubser: Arabic Sign Language Recognition

**Mubser** is an AI-powered tool that bridges the communication gap between deaf individuals and the hearing community by translating Arabic sign language into written text.

This repository contains the data pipeline and training code for two main models:

- **Model 1** — Alphabet-based sign recognition (Arabic sign letters)
- **Model 2** — Word-level sign recognition (common signs/words)

---

## 1. Features

- Real-time sign recognition via camera  
- Two-way pipeline design (sign-to-text, extendable to text-to-sign view)  
- CNN-based deep learning models  
- Custom Arabic sign language dataset (collected and generated)

---
